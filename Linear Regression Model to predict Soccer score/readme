Approach

This project starts with a real-life example for regression analysis, with an introduction to simple and multiple linear regression. Building the statistical foundation for the regression, it gives you a brief idea of the formula of regression. With this background, the first regression model in python is built. Going through the interpolation and extrapolation also explains errors in regression and Lurking variables. The point estimators of mean and variance and distributions of underlying parameters are also discussed. The coefficient of determination is also known, and R squared is briefly explained. The project ends with diagnostics and remedial measures for regression with a practical explanation.
