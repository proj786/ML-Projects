        "\n",
        "* Dropping missing values: This approach involves dropping the rows or columns that contain missing values. However, this method may lead to loss of information, especially if a large number of rows or columns have missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Imputing missing values: This approach involves filling in the missing values with a value that is either derived from other observations or estimated using statistical methods. Common imputation methods include mean imputation, median imputation, and regression imputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Using advanced methods: There are more advanced methods for handling missing data such as multiple imputation, k-nearest neighbors imputation, and matrix completion. These methods can be more accurate than simple imputation methods, but they may also be more computationally intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the choice of how to handle missing values will depend on the specific problem and dataset. It is important to carefully consider the impact of missing values on the analysis and choose an appropriate method that balances the need for accurate results with the computational complexity of the method.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the context of regression models, finding and removing correlated features is an essential step in preprocessing the data. Correlation is a statistical measure that describes how strongly two variables are related to each other. In the case of features, if two features have a high correlation with each other, it means that they provide similar information to the model, which can cause issues such as overfitting, multicollinearity, and reduced interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "To find correlated features, we typically calculate a correlation matrix between all pairs of features. We can use tools such as NumPy's corrcoef function or Pandas' corr method to compute the correlation matrix. Once we have the correlation matrix, we can identify highly correlated feature pairs by looking at the absolute values of the correlation coefficients.\n",

When a seed is set, the random numbers generated by the computer are deterministic, meaning they will always be the same. This can be helpful when testing and comparing different models or algorithms, as it ensures that the results are consistent and not affected by random chance."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to find the parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the cost function of a model. In the context of linear regression, the goal is to find the values of the weight vector (W) and the bias term (b) that best fit the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea of gradient descent is to iteratively update the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights and biases. The gradient is simply the vector of partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each weight and bias. By taking steps in the direction of the negative gradient, the algorithm can gradually minimize the cost function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The steps involved in gradient descent are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Initialize the weight vector (W) and the bias term (b) to small random values.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Calculate the predicted values (y_hat) for the training data using the current values of the weight vector and the bias term.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weight vector and the bias term using the error calculated in step 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Update the weight vector and the bias term by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient using the learning rate (alpha).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Repeat steps 2-5 until the cost function converges to a minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a cost function J and a set of parameters (W,b), the gradient of J with respect to the parameters can be calculated using partial derivatives\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal of gradient descent is to find the values of $w$ that minimize the cost function $J(w)$. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for $w$ and iteratively updates it using the following rule:\n",

        "$$w_j = w_j - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial J(w)}{\\partial w_j}$$\n",

        "The regression line regress towards the mean to create the best fit which essentially means that the errors are at the lowest. In the above plot, it is visible that the regression line is not able to exactly predict the true values. There is always going to be some space for errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's understand the various errors in Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* The mean absolute error (MAE) is the most basic regression error statistic to grasp. We'll compute the residual for each data point individually, using only the absolute value of each so that negative and positive residuals don't cancel out. The average of all these residuals is then calculated. MAE essentially describes the typical magnitude of the residuals. <br>\n",
        "$$MAE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y-\\hat y|$$\n",
        "\n",
        "* The mean square error (MSE) is identical to the mean absolute error (MAE) but squares the difference before aggregating all of them. The MSE will nearly always be greater than the MAE because we are squaring the difference. Because of this, we are unable to directly compare the MAE and MSE. We are limited to comparing the error metrics of our model to those of a rival model. The presence of outliers in our data makes the square term's impact on the MSE equation very clear. In MAE, each residual adds proportionally to the overall error, whereas in MSE, the error increases quadratically. As a result, our data outliers will ultimately result in a considerably bigger total error in the MSE than they will in the MAE. Similarly to this, our model will suffer more if it predicts values that are significantly different from the matching actual value.\n",
        "This means that in MSE as opposed to MAE, substantial disparities between actual and predicted values are punished more severely. <br>If we wish to limit the importance of outliers, we should use MAE because outlier residuals do not contribute as much to overall error as MSE. Finally, the decision between MSE and MAE is application-specific and depends on how large errors need to be handled.\n",
